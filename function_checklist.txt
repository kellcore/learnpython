Python Function Checklist!

When Writing:

Did you start your function definition with def?
Does your function name have only characters and underscores?
Did you put an open parenthesis right after the function name?
Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis separated by commas?
Did you make each argument unique?
Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon after the arguments?
Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces?
Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting)?

When Calling:

Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
Did you put the values you want into the parentheses separated by commas?
Did you end the function call with a ) character?
